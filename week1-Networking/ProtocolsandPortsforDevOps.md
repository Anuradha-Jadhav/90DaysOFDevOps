### **17. VNC (Virtual Network Computing)**  
- **Port**: 5900  
- **Usage**: VNC is used for graphical desktop sharing. In some DevOps environments, it's used to access graphical interfaces on remote systems for troubleshooting or configuration purposes.

---

### **18. Prometheus**  
- **Port**: 9090  
- **Usage**: Prometheus is a monitoring and alerting toolkit often used in DevOps. Port 9090 is the default port for accessing Prometheus’s web interface to query data and set up monitoring metrics.

---

### **19. Grafana**  
- **Port**: 3000  
- **Usage**: Grafana is a visualization and analytics tool that integrates with Prometheus, InfluxDB, and other data sources. DevOps teams use it for monitoring dashboards and visualizing metrics.

---

### **20. Vault (HashiCorp Vault)**  
- **Port**: 8200  
- **Usage**: Vault is used for secrets management in DevOps environments, allowing secure storage and access to sensitive information like passwords, API keys, and certificates.
