🚀 Project: DevOps Linux Server Monitoring & Automation

Imagine you're managing a Linux-based production server and need to ensure that users, logs, and processes are well-managed. You will perform real-world tasks such as log analysis, volume management, and automation to enhance your DevOps skills.
📌 Tasks
1️⃣ User & Group Management

    Learn about Linux users, groups, and permissions (/etc/passwd, /etc/group).
    Task:
        Create a user devops_user and add them to a group devops_team.
        Set a password and grant sudo access.
        Restrict SSH login for certain users in /etc/ssh/sshd_config.

2️⃣ File & Directory Permissions

    Task:
        Create /devops_workspace and a file project_notes.txt.
        Set permissions:
            Owner can edit, group can read, others have no access.
        Use ls -l to verify permissions.

3️⃣ Log File Analysis with AWK, Grep & Sed

Logs are crucial in DevOps! You’ll analyze logs using the Linux_2k.log file from LogHub (GitHub Repo).

    Task:
        Download the log file from the repository.
        Extract insights using commands:
            Use grep to find all occurrences of the word "error".
            Use awk to extract timestamps and log levels.
            Use sed to replace all IP addresses with [REDACTED] for security.
        Bonus: Find the most frequent log entry using awk or sort | uniq -c | sort -nr | head -10.

4️⃣ Volume Management & Disk Usage

    Task:
        Create a directory /mnt/devops_data.
        Mount a new volume (or loop device for local practice).
        Verify using df -h and mount | grep devops_data.

5️⃣ Process Management & Monitoring

    Task:
        Start a background process (ping google.com > ping_test.log &).
        Use ps, top, and htop to monitor it.
        Kill the process and verify it's gone.

6️⃣ Automate Backups with Shell Scripting

    Task:
        Write a shell script to back up /devops_workspace as backup_$(date +%F).tar.gz.
        Save it in /backups and schedule it using cron.
        Make the script display a success message in green text using echo -e.

🎯 Bonus Tasks (Optional 🚀)

    Find the top 5 most common log messages in Linux_2k.log using awk and sort.
    Use find to list all files modified in the last 7 days.
    Write a script that extracts and displays only ERROR and WARNING logs from Linux_2k.log.
